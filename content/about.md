### MY PROFESSIONAL SIDE:
I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science since 2017 from [UniCarioca](https://www.unicarioca.edu.br/).

I have been working with IT since 2011. During this time, I worked as Support, SysAdmin, Developer, Data Science and Business Intelligence (not necessarily in that order)

However, it was only in 2014 that I discovered that I love writing code and building/improving infrastructure with more resilience, performance and high availability.

My motto is: **"focus and determination"**

### MY PERSONAL SIDE:
I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and currently I am living in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

I am a **nerd** and an **enthusiast** of technologies/games.

I am from the 90s and I followed the beginning of technological evolution.

#### Fun Facts:

- :space_invader: When I was a young boy (4 years old), I played the first game on **Nintendo 8-bits**.
- :video_game: At 5 years old I got my first video game (**Master System III**) from my father.
- :computer: At 12 years old I got my first computer from my mother and I remember it like it was today (**K6 II 500mhz with 64mb RAM**) and a new world started for me.
By the way, at 12 years I did my first *computer course* as well.

I believe that my passion started in my childhood.
