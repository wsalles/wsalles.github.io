### MY PROFESSIONAL SIDE:
I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science since 2017 from [UniCarioca](https://www.unicarioca.edu.br/).

I have been working with IT since 2011. During this time, I worked as SysAdmin, Developer, Data Science, Business Intelligence and Support (not necessarily in that order)

However, it was only in 2014 that I discovered that I love writing code and building and improving infrastructure with more resilience, performance, and high availability.

My motto is: **"focus and determination"**

### MY PERSONAL SIDE:
I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I am a **nerd** and an **enthusiast** of technologies/games.

I am from the 90s and I followed the beginning of technological evolution.

[:video_game:] When I was a young boy (4 years old), I played the first **Nintendo 8-bits** video game. At 5 years old I got my first **Master System III** video game from by father.

[:computer:] At 12 years old I got my first computer from my mother and I remember it like it was today (K6 II 500mhz with 64mb RAM) and a new world started for me.
By the way, at 12 years I did my first *computer course*.
